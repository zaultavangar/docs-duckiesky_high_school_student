Be creative but you should have in your edit:

1. Add a new section for yourself with a level two heading (##) or higher.
    - Don't use a level one heading (#) because that will create a new page!
2. Tell us why you are interested in this course!
3. Bold and/or italize words or phrases.
4. Use an ordered or unordered list.
5. Use a special tag to do something cool!

## Lucas Furtado Section

- I am interested in this course because: 
- I ** always** wanted to build a drone. 
    1. but specifically, drones with cameras.
    2. Drones with 4 propellers 
- I think this will help me with my building and ** Engenering ** skills 
- I _want to learn how to program a drone but also what parts makes a drone_ 
ps: This is my first time building a drone 


## Luisangel Morales
**_I am intrested in this course becasue it's something new and intresting so I thought it would be fun and exciting to do._**

1. I want to learn and understand about coding 
2. I also want to know and understand  the mechanics on buliding a drone 

- This will help me understand how to program a drone. 
    - This will also help me learn how to use basic skills on building and engenering.


## Serigne section

## Sylvia's Section

I am interested in this course because:

- I wanted to try something that was way out of my comfort zone
    - Building a drone would be a good learning experience
- I want to know what goes into programming and coding a drone
    - Including how long the process of building the drone takes
- I've always wanted to buy a drone, but being able to build one is much cooler
    - Learning about all of the parts of a drone should also be a fun experience

## Rebecca's Section

**Hi people**

I wanted to be in this class for multiple reasons:

1. I'll learn the basic skills for building a drone
2. I'll learn how to code and program a drone
3. And I could potentially use the knowledge I gain from this class and use it in the outside world
