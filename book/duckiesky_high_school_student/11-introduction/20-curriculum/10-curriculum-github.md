## Git and GitHub Information

- What are Git and Github?
    - Git is a widely used version control system. 
        - Version control systems are software programs that allow programmers and code-based project workers to manage the changes to their code-based projects over time with new versions.
    - GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, or an online datastructure that is a basis for storing and presenting these code projects.
        - It's kind of like Google Drive, but for software programmers!

Note: An open-sourced project is a project where the code used to make a particular program or application is availible to everyone.

Checkout these big name companies that have open-sourced GitHub projects! You can actually look at the code that makes things run directly:

- [Twitter](https://github.com/twitter)
- [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix)
- [Adobe](https://github.com/adobe)

- What is the purpose of learning about GitHub?
    - It is an industry standard for most code-based projects.
    - This very textbook is hosted through GitHub!
        - We have worked really hard to make this curriculum for you, but we know there are bound to be mistakes or sections that can be improved. As a result, we would like you to be able to edit and improve this textbook; the more helpful you are in helping us improve this textbook, the better the course experience will be for you and for students learning this curriculum in the future!
        - The next lesson, Markdown and Contributions, will cover the programming language each individual page of the textbook is written in. You will learn today about the overall structure of projects hosted through GitHub (like our textbook) and how to propose changes to a GitHub repo.

## Learning Git and Github

- [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cNHvO-TTIC7_tBin4QTZhMfuATdPnSV/view?usp=sharing) is a worksheet on GitHub defintions that you can use while going through the tutorials to keep track of the terms or afterwards to assess the material that you have learned!
- Learn the Basics of Git and GitHub here!
    - First, follow this [Introduction to GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
    - Next, follow this [Forking Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
        - For this tutorial, you do not need to use GitHub Desktop or a text editor as of now, but you will want to read the section so you know what clones and commits are and how they are done!
    - Last, follow this [Issue Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) up until the "Notifications, @mentions, and References" section.
