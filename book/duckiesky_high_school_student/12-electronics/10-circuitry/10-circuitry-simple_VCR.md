# Simple Circuits and Concepts of Voltage, Current, and Resistance {#electronics-circuitry-simple_VCR status=ready}

An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements, and a way of communicating or transferring energy from one point to another. To explain all electrical phenomena, we must introduce the concept of electric charge, the basic property of matter carried by atomic particles that governs how the particles are affected by an electric or magnetic field. Electric charge, or electricity, is mobile, i.e. it can be transferred from one place to another. To better understand this notion, consider a conducting wire, which consists of several atoms, connected to a battery. When such a connection is made, the charges move along the wire: positive charges, carried by protons, move in one direction, while negative charges, carried by electrons, move in the opposite direction. This movement creates electric current. Mathematically, current can be described as the rate at which charge flows past a point on a circuit. It is represented by the symbol I and is measured in amperes (A). There are two ways to describe current flow: direct current (DC) in which current flows in only one direction, and alternating current (AC) in which current flows in both directions. Examples of DC electronics include computers, mobile phones, and flashlights, while AC is used to deliver power to houses, office buildings etc. Note that home power sockets are AC current, and thus most household appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, fans, lamps, or toasters use AC.

For charge to move, some work or energy transfer, performed by an external electromotive force (emf) is required. This emf, an example of which is a battery, is also known as a voltage, represented by the symbol V and defined as the energy required to move a unit charge from one point to another. Voltage is measured in volts (V). Current and voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits, but as important to understand is the notion of resistance in circuits. Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the flow of electric charge. This physical property, or the ability to resist current, is known as resistance, represented mathematically by the symbol R and measured in ohms (Ω). Conductors, such as copper and aluminum, have low resistivities, while insulators, such as plastic and paper, have high resistivities. To better understand the flow of current in a circuit and the concepts of voltage, current, and resistance, we can think of a mechanical system in which water is pushed through a closed pipe, as seen in the image below; this system very similar to an electric circuit:

The water flowing is analogous to electric current. The pipe is like the wire in the circuit. The pump is like the battery. The pressure generated by the pump drives water through the pipe; that pressure is like the voltage generated by the battery, which drives electrons through the circuit. The seashells block the pipe and obstruct the movement of water, creating a pressure difference from one end to the other. Similarly, resistance in the electric circuit resists the flow of electricity and creates a voltage drop from one end to the other.

Now that we’ve introduced current, voltage, and resistance, we can explore the mathematical relationship between the three. Ohm’s Law, discovered by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, states that the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through the resistor. He defined proportionality constant for the resistor to be its resistance, R. Mathematically, Ohm’s Law can therefore be represented as V=IR. Please refer to this [Ohm's Law interactive simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/ohms-law/latest/ohms-law_en.html) and play around with the sliders for the voltage and resistance in the circuit to see how it affects current.

For various engineering applications, and for this upcoming build, it is important to be able to measure voltage, current, and resistance. We can do this using a measuring device known as a digital multimeter. If you are not already familiar with multimeters, please watch this [multimeter tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUK6RPdIrA), which does a great job covering the basic functions of a multimeter. Note that your multimeters are not the exact same as the one used in the video. They are very similar however, so the video’s instructions should be straightforward to replicate on your Plusivo multimeter model!
