# Signals and Connections {#electronics-circuitry-signals status=ready}

In the same way that an alarm gives a signal that it’s time to get up, in electronics, the term signal is used for an electric quantity such as voltage, current, or an electromagnetic wave when it is used for conveying information. A message can be encoded with electric current by changing the voltage in a circuit, for example. There are two different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital signals. 

__Analog signals__

An analog signal is a continuous, time-varying signal. The signal can assume an infinite number of values in a given range. 
Video and audio transmissions are often transferred or recorded using analog signals. Pure audio signals are also analog. For example, the signal that comes out of a microphone is full of analog frequencies and harmonics, which combine to make music! Note that analog signals are subject to and vulnerable to noise, which can come from various sources and can distort or block transmitted information.

__Digital signals__

Our number system uses base-10 (10 symbols), aka the decimal numeration system, to represent numbers, but there are many other ways to convey information!

There’s no reason we have to use 10 symbols, you can get away with just 2—binary! (or other numbers: eight-octal, sixteen-hexadecimal). Here is an [ASCII table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html) that shows how numbers can be represented using different numeration systems. Be sure to click “Expand” to display the “Binary” column in the table. 

How does this relate to digital signals? Well, a digital signal is a non-continuous signal sent using pulses of voltage that switch current on and off. Digital signals encode information using this binary, or two-digit code, consisting of 0s (current off), and 1s (current on). 
	
With regards to applications, most modern electronic devices such as computers and phones encode data as digital signals. Compared with analog signals, digital signals are easier to transmit, better suited for longer distances, and more accurate. If you’re not quite sure why this might be, please watch this video from the 45 second mark: [Analog and digital signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu6L4kQF3k).

Your teacher may assign you to construct a flippydo—a useful paper device that can help you translate our decimal system into binary! Here are links to written instructions and a video explanation for the flippydo: [Flippydo Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnD9khmPUz1az3ZLc5L8vavR6lU0uScspotRhORnHxE/edit), [Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDWj1a4BZjQ).

Note that in practice, analog signals are often converted to digital signals using a device known as an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The opposite, converting digital to analog signals, is less common, but can be done using, you guessed it, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)!
