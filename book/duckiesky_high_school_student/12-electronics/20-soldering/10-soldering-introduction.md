# Intro to Soldering {#electronics-soldering-introduction status=ready}

To put the drone together, wires have to be connected to each other, to sensors, and other electrical components to form electrical connections. To do this, connections are formed by heating and cooling the malleable metal known as solder. The soldering iron is the tool used to heat the solder. Remember, solder can get very hot and fling out. It is necessary to wear eye protection, as well as to not breathe in soldering fumes. To make the soldering of two wires or any two elements easier, make use of the helping hands or long-nose pliers in your kit. Tinning is what you do before you solder, which is coating a metal with solder to help it join and flow electricity better to another wire. Here’s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRPF4wpXX9Q) that shows how to properly tin a wire.  

**Vocabulary:**

See also:  Soldering is when two metals (solder and metal) are melted together. You use solder to join wires.
 

See also:   Tinning is what you do before you solder, which is coating a metal with a layer of solder to help it join and flow electricity better to another wire.


**Important Safety Tips:** 

- The soldering iron is hot, so only apply it to needed components

- Solder can fling out so it is always necessary to have eye protection

- Do not breathe in the soldering fumes

- The metals that the solder is next to are also hot, so use helping hands or long-nose pliers when manipulating them


**Here's a step by step on how to tin a wire:**

1. Twist the loose wire ends into a tight twist.

2. Hold the wire stably in place with the helping hands or a plier.

3. Apply a solder dot onto the iron (to increase heat transfer from the iron to the wire).

4. Apply the iron onto the wire about to be tinned. Wait a few seconds for the wire to heat up.

5. Apply the solder onto the wire NOT THE IRON , and let the solder melt and flow into and on the wire.

6. Wipe away any excess solder with the iron being careful to not fling it too aggressively so to avoid burning someone/something.

7. Remove the iron and clean it.

8. Let the wire cool.

Note: A pre-tinned wire is a wire tinned at the factory. It looks shiny on the tip and the end cannot be frayed. For this course’s purposes, you should cut the pre-tinned end, strip the wire casing, and continue self-tinning as described above or seen in the linked video from this section's first paragraph.
