# Troubleshooting {#electronics-soldering-troubleshooting status=ready}

To fix a soldering mistake, using a desoldering wick or a desoldering pump is a common solution. While in general, both methods can be used interchangeably, it is often advisable to use a desoldering pump to remove large amounts of solder and a desoldering wick to remove smaller amounts of solder. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG7yW9FigJA) to help familiarize yourself with both methods.
 
A cold joint occurs when the solder does not melt completely. A result of insufficient heat, cold joints are often characterized by being rigid, rough, and uneven in appearance. If not addressed, such a joint is highly susceptible to cracking and failure and can jeopardize your build. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLubdi6aC3g) for how to troubleshoot a cold joint. 

A multimeter is a helpful tool to check for continuity. If you need a refresher on how to perform a continuity check using a multimeter, refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUK6RPdIrA) from unit B.1.1.
