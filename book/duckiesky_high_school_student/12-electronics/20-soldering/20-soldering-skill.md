To solder with flux, simply follow the steps of soldering from the previous lesson, except before tinning the wire, stick the soldering iron into the flux and apply it on the wires. This will make the solder flow easier, but is not always necessary. Here’s a helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z8CzB4BYJA) that demonstrates this.

Through-hole soldering is another form of soldering used on the drone’s Pi. This is simply when a wire is stuck through a previously made hole on a printed circuit board (PCB). To complete through-hole soldering, tin the wire, stick it through the pre-made hole, and solder the tip of the wire to the metal surrounding the hole. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAx89WhpZ3k) is a great demonstration of this technique.

Lastly, one of the longer and more challenging parts of the build is soldering bullet connectors to the ESC wires. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oBy-jV9ajE) outlines the technique that should be used when practicing this type of soldering. Note that your soldering iron tip may not fit inside the hole of the bullet connector. If this is the case, simply place the iron on the outside of the bullet connector and follow the same steps outlined in the linked video. The solder might take a bit longer to melt, but be patient!
