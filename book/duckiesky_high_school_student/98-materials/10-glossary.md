- Cloning
    - A [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
- DuckieSky
    - [DuckieSky](https://sites.brown.edu/duckiesky/) is a program within Duckietown lead by Professor Stefanie Tellex that develops and manages the MOOC-based drone curriculum in this book and that distributes drone kits to high schools throughout Rhode Island.
- The Duckietown Foundation
    - [The Duckietown Foundation](https://www.duckietown.org/about/duckietown-foundation) is the non-profit foundation that develops and promotes the Duckietown project, which explores autonomous robot platforms. You can read more about Duckietown.
- Fork
    - A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.
- Git
    - [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of. 
- GitHub
    - [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is a Git repository hosting service, or an online datastructure that is a basis for storing and presenting these code projects.
- HTML
